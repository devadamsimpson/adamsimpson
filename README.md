Technical Specs and Run Down of Me

# Hi, I’m Adam Simpson 👋

### // Senior Operations Leader transitioning to Technical Engineering

I am a career-changer with a 15-year background in high-level management and technical infrastructure. My experience ranges from managing large-scale commercial operations to acting as a regional consultant for 4DX motion systems. I am currently applying my aptitude for logic-based troubleshooting and systems architecture to **Full-Stack Development** and **Robotics**.

---

### // The Technical Pivot
I am currently dedicating my focus to a disciplined learning path in C# and Python. My goal is to combine my seniority in operational management with hard technical skills to solve complex problems in robotics and system automation.

## // Core Competencies & Experience
> Systems Logic: Expert in troubleshooting complex hardware/software intersections (4DX Motion Systems).
> Data-Driven Ops: Extensive experience in P&L architecture and resource optimization.
> Leadership: 15 years of experience leading multi-disciplinary teams and regional initiatives.
> Hardware: City & Guilds Electrical Maintenance; hands-on experience with mechanical and electrical systems.

## // Current Projects
🤖 DIY Robotics: Developing logic-based control systems using C#.
🏠 Home Automation: Building custom Python scripts to integrate and automate IoT devices.
📚 Stack Study: Currently deep-diving into Full-Stack architecture and data structures.
